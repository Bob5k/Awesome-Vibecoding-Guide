# The Comprehensive Vibecoding Guide

## From a practitioner, for practitioners

A compendium drawn from real commercial projects and hundreds of thousands of lines of AI‑assisted code. Read it end‑to‑end or feed this repo to your AI agent for summaries and Q&A. Stars and watches appreciated! ⭐

Also, this guide is basically a collection of my thoughts - you may disagree with them :)
Main thought tho - as long as certain steps are followed - the LLM behind used for vibecoding itself matters less - as with proper technique and overall setup even 'worse' LLMs than frontier models will be able to deliver whatever you need (at least in terms of web development)
