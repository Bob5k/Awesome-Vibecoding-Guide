# Claude Code CLI Client — Backup Coding Agent 🏎️

## Why Claude Code (backup)?
- Seamless with GLM Coding Plan (same as Droid)
- A bit faster for small changes and tight loops
- Currently configured to use GLM 4.6 natively in my setup

## When to use
- Small diffs, quick refactors, and single‑file changes
- When I need a fast turnaround aligned with the GLM plan
