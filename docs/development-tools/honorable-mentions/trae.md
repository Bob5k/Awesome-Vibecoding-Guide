# TRAE

## Overview
TRAE is a coding assistant tool that offers an interesting value proposition with its prompt-based pricing model. While I initially dropped it from my main stack, I occasionally return to use up my monthly quota, especially given the generous 600-900 prompts per month for just $10.

## Key Strengths
- **Excellent Value**: 600 prompts/month (recently increased to 900) for $10 is hard to beat
- **Cost-Effective Usage**: Great for consuming included quota when you've paid annually
- **Solo Mode Access**: Available to some users (though I prefer OpenSpec for planning)
- **Regular Usage**: Good for occasional coding tasks when you want to save on API costs

## Best Use Cases
- Using up monthly quota from annual subscription to maximize value
- Simple coding tasks where sophisticated reasoning isn't critical
- Backup tool when main stack providers are experiencing issues
- Experimentation with different AI approaches

## Limitations
- **Limited Context Window**: Restricts complex project work
- **Solo Mode Accessibility**: Not widely available to all users
- **Planning Capabilities**: OpenSpec is superior for software development planning (even vs. SOLO mode - OpenSpec is just better)
- **Annual Plan Recommendation**: I wouldn't recommend paying for annual plan upfront (my mistake)

## Personal Usage Notes
I occasionally return to TRAE mainly to maximize value from my annual subscription - the 900 prompts per month for $10 is genuinely an awesome deal when you want to have IDE combined with AI availability in a single place with a v. cheap subscription. While I don't use it for my main development workflow, it serves as a useful backup and quota consumption tool. The limited context window makes it less suitable for complex projects, but for straightforward coding tasks, it's perfectly adequate.

However, there are other compelling options that might be even more cost-effective:

- **[GLM Coding Plan](../../ai-model-providers/glm-coding-plan.md)** - Offers even cheaper basic access plans and serves as an excellent alternative for budget-conscious developers

- **[Synthetic.new](../../ai-model-providers/synthetic-new.md)** - Provides significantly more prompts per month with very good open-source models, making it an excellent choice for developers who want to build a lot of things while maintaining privacy

Both alternatives allow users to develop extensively while keeping costs low, making them worth considering alongside or instead of TRAE depending on your specific needs and usage patterns.
