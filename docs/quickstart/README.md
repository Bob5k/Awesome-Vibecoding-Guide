# Quickstart ðŸš€

Follow these steps to start vibecoding effectively:

1. Define the feature and outcomes (write a brief PRD).
2. Create specifications per feature (OpenSpec or your preferred format).
3. Set up your stack: Zed, GLM, Context7 MCP, DevTools MCP.
4. Load only relevant files into context; keep it lean.
5. Implement tasks one by one with an AI agent; review after each.
6. Test using DevTools MCP first, then manual checks.
7. Commit per finished feature; review before merge.
