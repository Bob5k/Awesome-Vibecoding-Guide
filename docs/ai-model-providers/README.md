# AI Model Providers 🤖

A curated selection of AI model providers and services optimized for vibecoding workflows. These providers offer the intelligence and reasoning capabilities that power modern development workflows.

## Primary AI Providers

### Core LLM Services
- **[GLM Coding Plan](./glm-coding-plan.md)** — Main LLM provider for coding assistance
- **[Synthetic.new](./synthetic-new.md)** — Privacy-first provider with extensive model library and competitive pricing
- **[Factory AI](./factory-ai.md)** — Advanced AI platform for specialized tasks (Coming soon)

## Honorable Mentions
Services I've used but don't recommend for primary development work:
- **[Honorable Mentions](./honorable-mentions/README.md)** — Services with caveats, learning platforms, budget platforms, or over-expensive options

These providers can be valuable for experimentation and learning, but have reliability, performance, or cost concerns (from too cheap/unreliable to prohibitively expensive) that make them unsuitable for serious professional development.

## Integration Philosophy

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Approach
All recommended providers support external API integration:
- **Cost Control**: Pay only for what you use
- **Provider Flexibility**: Switch between providers based on needs
- **Model Selection**: Choose optimal models for specific tasks
- **Privacy & Security**: Maintain control over your data and API keys

### Performance Optimization
Providers selected for:
- **Speed**: Fast response times for rapid development iterations
- **Quality**: High-quality code generation and reasoning
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance and availability
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Competitive pricing for development workflows

## Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow Integration
AI providers work seamlessly with the development tools stack:
- **Code Generation**: Generate boilerplate, functions, and complete implementations
- **Debugging Assistance**: Identify and fix bugs with AI-powered analysis
- **Code Review**: Get automated feedback on code quality and best practices
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain code documentation

### Task-Specific Model Selection
Different tasks benefit from different AI models:
- **Simple Tasks**: Use cost-effective models for basic code generation
- **Complex Problems**: Leverage advanced models for challenging architectural decisions
- **Specialized Domains**: Choose models trained on specific technologies or frameworks

## Cost Management

### Optimization Strategies
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for task complexity
- **Token Management**: Optimize prompts to reduce API costs
- **Caching**: Store and reuse common responses
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests for efficiency

### Budget Planning
- **Free Tiers**: Leverage free offerings from various providers
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track API usage and costs across providers
- **Cost Comparison**: Compare pricing across different providers
- **Scaling Strategy**: Plan cost scaling as projects grow

## Configuration & Setup

### API Key Management
- **Security**: Store API keys securely using environment variables
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys for security
- **Backup**: Maintain backup keys for failover scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and costs

### Provider Configuration
- **Endpoint Setup**: Configure custom endpoints for optimal performance
- **Model Parameters**: Fine-tune model settings for specific use cases
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to control costs
- **Error Handling**: Set up proper error handling and retry logic

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- **Clarity**: Write clear, specific prompts for better results
- **Context**: Provide relevant context about your project and requirements
- **Iteration**: Refine prompts based on results and feedback
- **Consistency**: Use consistent prompt patterns for predictable results

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Review**: Always review AI-generated code before deployment
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test AI-generated implementations
- **Security**: Validate AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Test performance of AI-generated solutions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **API Limits**: Handle rate limits and quota exceeded errors
- **Model Availability**: Manage temporary model unavailability
- **Quality Issues**: Address inconsistent or poor-quality responses
- **Integration Problems**: Resolve connectivity and configuration issues

### Support Resources
- **Provider Documentation**: Refer to official API documentation
- **Community Forums**: Get help from provider communities
- **Error Logs**: Monitor and analyze error logs for troubleshooting
- **Alternative Providers**: Maintain backup providers for reliability

## Future Roadmap

### Upcoming Features
- **Factory AI Integration**: Enhanced AI platform with specialized capabilities
