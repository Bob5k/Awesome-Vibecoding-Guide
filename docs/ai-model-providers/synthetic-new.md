## Hands-On Testing Experience

The author of this guide is currently testing a Synthetic.new subscription using the octofriend CLI, and the offering has proven impressive on several fronts:

### Performance & Speed
The API works seamlessly with very good performance. GLM-4.6 reaches **200 tokens per second**, making it twice as fast as the GLM coding plan from z.ai. This speed advantage is consistent across the model lineup.

### Privacy Advantage
What makes Synthetic.new stand out is its **privacy-first approach**. There's no need to worry about the privacy of code you're developing, which is crucial for professional development work.

### Value Proposition
For a fair price, you receive **3x the amount of messages** compared to Claude Code, plus access to the majority of frontier open-source models. The seamless experience across all areas makes it compelling for:

1. **Privacy-conscious developers** who want to ensure their code remains private
2. **Model experimenters** who want to test different model schemes without multiple providers
3. **Developers seeking reliability** with single-provider uptime and consistent speed

### Competitive Edge
Compared to alternatives like OpenRouter or Chutes.ai:
- **Speed advantage**: Synthetic.new delivers significantly faster response times
- **Reliability**: Better uptime and more consistent performance
- **Simplicity**: Single provider access to multiple models vs managing multiple services

### Model Innovation
Synthetic.new frequently introduces new models like MiniMax M2, providing easy access to cutting-edge models alongside established ones like DeepSeek. This rapid model rollout keeps developers at the forefront of AI capabilities.

The combination of privacy, performance, competitive pricing, and extensive model selection makes Synthetic.new an intriguing option for developers looking for a comprehensive AI model solution.
