## Geographic Pricing Considerations

Pricing varies dramatically by location. Here's how to think about it:

### Your Cost of Living

**My Example (European Country):**
- $300 = Rent + utilities
- $1,000 = Family of 4 basic needs
- Target: 2 websites/month = $1,000

**Your Calculation:**
1. What's your monthly cost of living?
2. How much side income do you want?
3. How many websites can you realistically build per month?
4. Price = (Target Income ÷ Website Count) + 20% buffer

### Market Conditions

**High-Income Areas (US, Western Europe, Australia):**
- Can charge $800-1,500 for standard sites
- Clients have bigger budgets
- More competition, but higher quality expectations

**Mid-Income Areas (Eastern Europe, Latin America, Southeast Asia):**
- $300-700 is realistic
- Less competition at quality level
- Lower budgets but lower living costs

**Local vs. Remote:**
- Local clients: Match local market rates
- Remote clients: Can charge based on their location, not yours

## Value-Based Pricing

Don't just charge for time. Charge for value delivered.

### Savings-Based Pricing

**Client's Current Situation:**
- Hosting: $25/month = $300/year
- Maintenance: $50/month = $600/year
- **Total: $900/year ongoing**

**Your Proposal:**
- Website: $700 one-time
- Hosting: $0
- Maintenance: ~$50/year for minor updates

**Client's Savings:** ~$850/year after year 1

**Your Pitch:** "This website pays for itself in 9 months just from eliminated hosting fees. After that, you're saving $75/month forever."

This justifies higher pricing than purely time-based.

### Results-Based Pricing

What's the value of a new customer to them?

**Example: Local Electrician**
- Average job value: $500
- If website brings 2 extra customers/year: $1,000 value
- Your $600 website pays for itself with just 1.2 jobs

**Your Pitch:** "If this website brings you even one extra customer this year, it's paid for itself."

## Time-Based Economics

### Your Hourly Rate

**Target:** $50-100/hour effective rate

**$50/hour:**
- 6 hours of work = $300 minimum
- 8 hours of work = $400 minimum
- 10 hours of work = $500 minimum

**$75/hour:**
- 6 hours of work = $450 minimum
- 8 hours of work = $600 minimum
- 10 hours of work = $750 minimum

**$100/hour:**
- 6 hours of work = $600 minimum
- 8 hours of work = $800 minimum
- 10 hours of work = $1,000 minimum

### Efficiency Gains

**Your First Site:**
- 15-20 hours
- At $400 = $20-27/hour
- You're learning, this is OK

**Sites 5-10:**
- 8-10 hours
- At $500 = $50-63/hour
- Getting better

**Sites 10+:**
- 4-6 hours
- At $600 = $100-150/hour
- Now it's profitable

### Speed vs. Quality

Don't sacrifice quality for speed. But do:
- Build reusable components
- Create starter templates
- Standardize your workflow
- Use AI effectively for boilerplate

## Payment Structure

### Option 1: 50/50 Split
- 50% upfront (before starting)
- 50% on delivery (before domain transfer)

**Pros:** Cash flow, commitment from client
**Cons:** Client might disappear after first payment

### Option 2: 100% Upfront
- Full payment before starting work

**Pros:** No payment risk, validates serious clients
**Cons:** Harder to sell, clients may hesitate

### Option 3: Milestone-Based
- 30% on agreement
- 40% on design approval
- 30% on launch

**Pros:** Fair to both parties, spreads risk
**Cons:** More administrative overhead

**Recommended:** Start with 50/50, move to 100% upfront as you build reputation.

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor High

Don't start by saying "$300-700 depending on complexity."

Instead:
- "Standard websites start at $600"
- "For your needs, I'm thinking $700"
- "This would normally be $800, but since..."

Then you can adjust down if needed. Hard to adjust up.

### Bundle, Don't Itemize

**Bad:**
- Homepage: $200
- Services page: $150
- Contact form: $100
- Hosting setup: $50
- Total: $500

Clients will try to negotiate each line item.

**Good:**
- Complete professional website: $600
- Includes everything you need
- No hidden fees

### Compare to Alternatives

"Most agencies charge $2,000-5,000 for this. WordPress developers charge $800-1,200 plus $50/month maintenance. I charge $600 one-time with no monthly fees."

### Emphasize Savings

"You're saving $900/year in hosting and maintenance fees compared to traditional websites."

## When to Charge More

### Industry-Specific Reasons

**Premium Industries:**
- Medical/dental: +20-30%
- Legal: +20-30%
- Financial services: +20-30%

They have bigger budgets and higher expectations.

**Standard Industries:**
- Home services: Standard pricing
- Retail: Standard pricing
- Hospitality: Standard pricing

### Complexity Justifications

- Custom animations/interactions: +$100-200
- Advanced forms (multi-step, conditional): +$100
- Third-party integrations: +$150-300 each
- Custom functionality: Quote based on time

### Rush Jobs

- Need it in <1 week: +30%
- Need it in <3 days: +50%
- Need it in 24 hours: +100%

Your time is valuable. Rush work disrupts your schedule.

## When to Charge Less

### Portfolio Building (First 5 Sites)

Lower prices to:
- Get experience
- Build portfolio
- Earn testimonials
- Refine process

But never go below your minimum. Know your floor.

### Referral Discounts

- "Refer 3 clients, get $100 off your next update"
- Builds referral pipeline
- Creates loyalty

### Non-Profit/Community

- 20-30% discount for verified non-profits
- Good for portfolio diversity
- Community goodwill

But don't work for free. Even non-profits have budgets.

## Cost Analysis

### Your Costs Per Website

**Tools (Monthly, Amortized):**
- AI provider: $50-100/month
- Domain for testing: $12/year
- Design tools: $0-20/month
- **Total: ~$15-25 per website** (if doing 4/month)

**Time (Opportunity Cost):**
- 6 hours at $50/hour = $300
- This is your minimum viable price

**Net Profit Targets:**
- $300 website - $25 costs = $275 net (~$46/hour)
- $500 website - $25 costs = $475 net (~$79/hour)
- $700 website - $25 costs = $675 net (~$112/hour)

## Minimum Viable Pricing

**Never go below this formula:**

Minimum Price = (Hours × Desired Hourly Rate) + Tool Costs + 20% buffer

**Example:**
- 6 hours × $40/hour = $240
- Tool costs: $25
- 20% buffer: $53
- **Minimum: $318**

Round to $300-350 to be competitive but profitable.

## Scaling Pricing

### Year 1: Building Phase
- $300-500 per site
- 1-2 sites/month
- **Target: $600-1,000/month**

### Year 2: Growth Phase
- $500-700 per site
- 2-4 sites/month
- **Target: $1,500-2,500/month**

### Year 3+: Professional Phase
- $700-1,200 per site
- 3-5 sites/month
- **Target: $2,500-5,000/month**

Or shift to fewer, higher-value clients at premium prices.

## The Bottom Line

**Charge based on:**
1. Value to client (savings, revenue potential)
2. Your efficiency (time required)
3. Market conditions (location, competition)
4. Your positioning (beginner, professional, premium)

**Don't charge based on:**
- What you think they can afford (they'll sense it)
- What your competitors charge (race to bottom)
- Your own insecurities (you're worth more than you think)

**Remember:**
- A $600 website in 5 hours = $120/hour
- That's good money for side income
- And it's solving a real problem for a real business
