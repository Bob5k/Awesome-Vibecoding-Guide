# Tools I Dropped â€” Traycer.ai ðŸª“

## Why I left
- Too slowâ€”planning takes long, validation too, fixes even longer
- Plugin dependencyâ€”requires VS Code/derivatives (no Zed support as per time of writing this guide)
- Costlyâ€”$25/month for realistic workloads (with recent pricing changes having 1 artifact per 45 minutes it might not be even enough for serious, fast paced development)
- Frustrationâ€”when the plan hallucinates, rollbacks waste lots of time

## What was good
- Automatic validation of ongoing development
- High output quality (when it works)
- Usually, the combination of plan + validation + improvements after validation improved overall project quality (at the cost of significantly longer delivery time).

## Conclusion
You can achieve similar results with OpenSpec + GLM for a fraction of the priceâ€”and often in less timeâ€”than with Traycer.
