# GLM Coding Plan â€” Main LLM ðŸ§ 

## Pricing
- Lite: $3/month â€” 120 prompts per 5 hours
- Pro: $15/month â€” 600 prompts per 5 hours
- Max: $30/month â€” 2,400 prompts per 5 hours
- Practicality of limits: Very hard to hit even with 2â€“5 parallel agents on Pro and Max plans
- Note: prices are for first month, but can be preserved on this level aswell for quarterly or yearly-basis plans
- Note2: I'm on Max plan currently, but haven't hit limits when I was on Pro plan for over a month in the past aswell
- **IMPORTANT** Currently the fastest combo of working with GLM is to conenct it to Claude Code. However - the most efficient combo is to connect it to Droid CLI - due to superior planning and following the plan architecture of Droid.
