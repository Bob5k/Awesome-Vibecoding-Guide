# Droid CLI â€” Main Coding Agent ðŸ¤–

## Why Droid CLI?
- Native specâ€‘writing plans and expert execution against those plans
- Seamless alignment with GLM Coding Plan and OpenSpecâ€‘driven workflows
- Strong for larger features and multiâ€‘step implementations
- Configurable model routing; occasional use of Codex and GPTâ€‘5â€‘high for bigger plans

## How I use it
- Author specs with OpenSpec â†’ run Droid CLI to plan â†’ implement tasks sequentially
- Pair with DevTools MCP for fast feedback and testing
