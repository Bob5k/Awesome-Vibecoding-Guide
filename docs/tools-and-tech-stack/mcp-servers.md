# MCP Servers â€” Recommendations ðŸ§©

I use:
- Context7â€”absolutely essential
- shadcn MCPâ€”smooth integration; essential for developing goodâ€‘looking websites using readyâ€‘toâ€‘use components
- Sequential Thinking MCPâ€”context and planning optimization
- Task Manager MCPâ€”project organization and proper planning tool to ensure that context doesn't get lost midâ€‘development.
- Task Manager tip: You can reference tasks or task groups across your coding agent sessions.

Note: Donâ€™t use too many MCPsâ€”they will quickly consume your context window!
