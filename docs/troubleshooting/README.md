## AI Behavior Issues

### AI Misunderstands Requirements

**Symptom:** AI implements something completely different from what you wanted.

**Root causes:**
1. Ambiguous language in prompt
2. Missing examples
3. No success criteria defined
4. Technical terms used differently than AI expects

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Use Examples**
```
Bad:
"Create a form with validation"

Good:
"Create a form with these exact behaviors:
- Email field: validate format on blur, show error 'Invalid email' below field
- Submit disabled until all fields valid
- Example: user types 'test@' → blur → red border + error shown"
```

**Solution 2: Define Success Criteria**
```
Add to every prompt:
"Success means:
- [Specific measurable outcome 1]
- [Specific measurable outcome 2]
- [Specific measurable outcome 3]"
```

**Solution 3: Show, Don't Just Tell**
```
Instead of: "Make it look professional"
Show: "Use this design: [link to screenshot or design]"
Or: "Match the style of [existing component]"
```

**Prevention:**
- Read [Prompt Foundations](../prompting/foundations.md#principle-2-show-dont-just-tell)
- Use [Prompt Templates](../prompting/template-library.md)
- Always include concrete examples

---

### Hallucination: APIs That Don't Exist

**Symptom:** AI generates code using functions/APIs that don't exist in your project or libraries.

**Example:**
```typescript
// AI generates:
import { magicValidator } from 'my-app/validators'; // DOESN'T EXIST!

user.validateMagically(); // DOESN'T EXIST!
```

**Root causes:**
1. AI guessing based on patterns
2. Confusing your project with similar projects
3. Outdated training data

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Reference Real Code**
```
"Use the existing validation pattern from src/utils/validation.ts:

```typescript
export function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  return EMAIL_REGEX.test(email);
}
```

Don't make up new functions. Use this exact pattern."
```

**Solution 2: Be Explicit About What Exists**
```
"Available utilities in src/utils/:
- validation.ts: validateEmail, validatePassword
- crypto.ts: hash, verify
- strings.ts: slugify, truncate

Use ONLY these. Don't create new utilities."
```

**Solution 3: Verify After Generation**
```
"After generating code, verify that all imported functions exist.
If you're unsure, ask me before including it in your response."
```

**Prevention:**
- Provide explicit file references
- Use "Follow pattern in [existing file]"
- Add verification step to prompts

---

### AI Ignores Constraints

**Symptom:** AI generates code that violates specified constraints (file size limits, no external dependencies, etc.)

**Example:**
```
You: "Don't use any external libraries"
AI: *Installs 5 npm packages*
```

**Root causes:**
1. Constraints buried in long prompt
2. Constraints stated weakly ("try to avoid..." vs "MUST NOT")
3. AI prioritizes functionality over constraints

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Emphasize Constraints**
```
"CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (must follow):
1. NO external dependencies (use only Node.js built-ins)
2. File size MAX 100 lines
3. NO database queries (work with in-memory data)

If any constraint is impossible, tell me before generating code."
```

**Solution 2: Front-Load Constraints**
```
Structure prompt:
1. Constraints FIRST
2. Requirements second
3. Implementation details last

This ensures AI reads constraints before thinking about solution.
```

**Solution 3: Use Self-Verifying Prompts**
```
"After generating code, verify:
- [ ] No external dependencies used
- [ ] File is <100 lines
- [ ] No database queries

If any check fails, revise the code before responding."
```

**Prevention:**
- Always list constraints first
- Use strong language ("MUST", "REQUIRED", "NEVER")
- Add verification step

---

### Over-Engineering

**Symptom:** AI generates overly complex solutions with unnecessary abstractions, design patterns, or features.

**Example:**
```
You: "Create a function to add two numbers"
AI: *Creates abstract factory pattern with interfaces, dependency injection, strategy pattern...*
```

**Root causes:**
1. No simplicity guidance
2. AI trained on enterprise codebases
3. No scope boundaries

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: YAGNI Principle**
```
"Create a simple function to add two numbers.

Requirements:
- Just add two numbers, nothing more
- No abstractions, interfaces, or design patterns
- Keep it simple (KISS principle)
- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It
- Maximum 5 lines of code"
```

**Solution 2: Specify Scope Explicitly**
```
"Implement ONLY what's needed for the current use case.
Don't add:
- Abstract base classes
- Dependency injection
- Strategy patterns
- Configuration systems
- Logging frameworks

Just solve the immediate problem."
```

**Solution 3: Reference Simple Examples**
```
"Follow the simplicity of this example:
[paste simple, direct code]

Keep the same level of simplicity. No additional complexity."
```

**Prevention:**
- Always add "Keep it simple"
- Specify maximum lines of code
- Reference simple examples
- Use YAGNI/KISS principles explicitly

---

### Context Overload: AI Forgets Things

**Symptom:** AI forgets previous decisions, contradicts earlier responses, or "doesn't remember" what you discussed.

**Root causes:**
1. Context window >85% full
2. Too many messages in conversation
3. Important info early in conversation (recency bias)

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Session Handoff**
```
"Write a summary of our work to docs/context/session-handoff.md:

Include:
- What we've implemented
- Decisions made (with reasoning)
- Current state
- Next steps

Be comprehensive - I'll start a new session after this."

[New session]
"Read docs/context/session-handoff.md and continue from where we left off."
```

**Solution 2: Externalize Decisions**
```
When AI makes important decision:
"Document this decision to docs/decisions/[number]-[topic].md:
- What we decided
- Why we decided it
- Alternatives considered
- Implications"

Future prompts: "Per docs/decisions/003-auth-approach.md, implement..."
```

**Solution 3: Context Refresh**
```
If context >70% full:
"Summarize our key decisions and current progress.
Then we'll start fresh with that summary."
```

**Prevention:**
- Monitor context usage (60-85% rule)
- Externalize to .md files early
- Use [Context Management strategies](../context-management/README.md)

---

### Slow AI Responses

**Symptom:** AI takes >30 seconds to respond, or responses are delayed.

**Root causes:**
1. Context too large (>100k tokens)
2. Too many files included
3. Complex request requiring lots of processing
4. API/model provider issues

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Reduce Context**
```
"Remove all files from context except:
- src/api/users.ts (relevant to current task)
- docs/architecture/api-design.md

Now implement [task]."
```

**Solution 2: Progressive Loading**
```
Don't load all files at once.
Start with: minimal context + architecture overview
Add files: only as needed for current step
Remove files: when task complete
```

**Solution 3: Use Faster Model**
```
For simple tasks:
- Use GLM (fast, cheap)
- Use Gemini Flash
- Use Qwen Coder

For complex tasks:
- Use Claude Sonnet
- Use Claude Opus (only when necessary)
```

**Prevention:**
- Keep context under 50k tokens when possible
- Use [Progressive Loading](../prompting/foundations.md#strategy-1-just-in-time-context-loading)
- Choose right model for task complexity

---

### Incomplete Responses (Cuts Off)

**Symptom:** AI response cuts off mid-sentence or mid-code block.

**Root causes:**
1. Response length limit reached
2. Context window completely full
3. Output token limit hit

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Ask to Continue**
```
"Continue from where you left off."

Or more specifically:
"Continue the function implementation from line 45."
```

**Solution 2: Request Smaller Chunks**
```
Instead of: "Implement entire authentication system"
Do: "Implement just the login function (Step 1 of 5)"

Complete each step before moving to next.
```

**Solution 3: Reduce Prompt Size**
```
Shorten your prompts:
- Use template references instead of full requirements
- Reference docs instead of pasting content
- Focus on current subtask only
```

**Prevention:**
- Break large tasks into steps
- Keep prompts concise
- Monitor context usage

---

### Code Style Doesn't Match Project

**Symptom:** AI generates code in different style (tabs vs spaces, naming conventions, patterns) than your project.

**Root causes:**
1. No style guide provided
2. No example code referenced
3. AI using generic style

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Create .cursorrules**
```
Create `.cursorrules` in project root:

# Code Style Guide

## Formatting
- Indentation: 2 spaces (not tabs)
- Quotes: single quotes for strings
- Semicolons: required
- Line length: max 100 characters

## Naming Conventions
- Files: kebab-case (user-service.ts)
- Components: PascalCase (UserCard)
- Functions: camelCase (getUserById)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (API_URL)

## Patterns
- React: functional components only (no classes)
- Async: use async/await (no .then())
- Errors: custom error classes (not generic Error)
- Imports: group by type (external, internal, relative)

## Examples
[Include code snippets showing style]
```

Now AI automatically follows these conventions.

**Solution 2: Reference Style Examples**
```
"Follow the exact code style from src/components/UserCard.tsx:
- Same formatting
- Same naming patterns
- Same import structure
- Same comment style"
```

**Solution 3: Request Style Match**
```
"Generate code matching the style of [existing file].
Specifically match:
- Indentation
- Naming conventions
- Function structure
- Comment style"
```

**Prevention:**
- Always create .cursorrules early
- Reference existing files for patterns
- Include style requirements in prompt templates

---

## Code Quality Problems

### Buggy Code on First Generation

**Symptom:** AI-generated code has obvious bugs, doesn't compile, or fails immediately when run.

**Root causes:**
1. Ambiguous requirements
2. Missing edge cases
3. Incomplete context
4. Model limitations

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Add Test Cases to Prompt**
```
"Create function to calculate factorial.

Must handle:
- factorial(0) = 1
- factorial(1) = 1
- factorial(5) = 120
- factorial(-1) = Error('Negative numbers not allowed')
- factorial(100) = use BigInt for large numbers

Include test cases demonstrating all scenarios work correctly."
```

**Solution 2: Request Self-Verification**
```
"After generating code, verify:
1. Code compiles without errors
2. All test cases pass
3. Edge cases handled
4. No obvious bugs

If verification fails, fix before responding."
```

**Solution 3: Provide More Context**
```
"Implement user login.

Context:
- Uses JWT authentication (src/utils/jwt.ts)
- Password hashing with bcrypt (src/utils/crypto.ts)
- User model in src/models/User.ts
- Error handling pattern from src/api/posts.ts

Reference these files for patterns and interfaces."
```

**Prevention:**
- Use detailed prompts with examples
- Include test scenarios
- Reference existing working code
- Add self-verification step

---

### Missing Error Handling

**Symptom:** AI generates happy-path code with no try-catch, no validation, no error responses.

**Root causes:**
1. Error handling not mentioned in prompt
2. AI prioritizes functionality over robustness

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Explicit Error Requirements**
```
"Implement file upload endpoint.

Error handling requirements:
- File too large (>10MB) → 400 'File exceeds maximum size'
- Invalid file type → 400 'Only PDF, PNG, JPG allowed'
- Network error during upload → 500 'Upload failed, please retry'
- Missing file in request → 400 'No file provided'
- S3 upload fails → 500 'Storage error' + log error

Use try-catch blocks.
Return consistent error format: { error: { code, message } }"
```

**Solution 2: Reference Error Patterns**
```
"Follow error handling pattern from src/api/users.ts:
- Try-catch around async operations
- Specific error messages for different failures
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error logging
- User-friendly error messages"
```

**Solution 3: Add to .cursorrules**
```
In .cursorrules:

## Error Handling
- ALWAYS use try-catch for async operations
- ALWAYS validate input
- ALWAYS return user-friendly error messages
- ALWAYS log errors with context
- Use custom error classes (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.)
```

**Prevention:**
- Always mention error handling in prompts
- Create error handling template
- Reference error patterns
- Add to project conventions

---

### Missing Input Validation

**Symptom:** AI generates code that accepts any input without validation, leading to crashes or security vulnerabilities.

**Root causes:**
1. Validation not specified
2. Security not prioritized

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Specify Validation Rules**
```
"Create user registration endpoint.

Validation requirements:
- Email:
  - Required
  - Valid email format (RFC 5322)
  - Max 255 characters
  - Unique (check database)
- Password:
  - Required
  - Min 8 characters
  - Must include: uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
- Name:
  - Required
  - Min 2, max 100 characters
  - Letters and spaces only (no special chars)

Return 400 with field-specific errors for validation failures."
```

**Solution 2: Use Validation Library**
```
"Use Zod for validation (already installed):

```typescript
const registerSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email().max(255),
  password: z.string().min(8).regex(/[A-Z]/).regex(/[a-z]/).regex(/[0-9]/),
  name: z.string().min(2).max(100).regex(/^[a-zA-Z ]+$/)
});
```

Validate request body against this schema before processing."
```

**Solution 3: Security-First Prompt**
```
"Implement [feature] with security as top priority:

Input validation:
- Sanitize all user input
- Validate types and formats
- Check length limits
- Prevent SQL injection
- Prevent XSS
- Whitelist approach (accept only known-good)

Fail securely: reject invalid input, don't try to fix it."
```

**Prevention:**
- Always specify validation in prompts
- Use validation libraries
- Create validation template
- Security-first mindset

### Poor Performance

**Symptom:** AI-generated code works but is slow (N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms, etc.)

**Root causes:**
1. Performance not mentioned
2. AI prioritizes simplicity/readability over efficiency

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Specify Performance Requirements**
```
"Implement user search with performance requirements:

Current: 5 seconds for 10,000 users
Target: <500ms for 10,000 users

Optimization requirements:
- Use database indexes (email, name columns)
- Pagination (20 results per page)
- Debounce search input (500ms)
- Cache results (5 minutes)
- No N+1 queries

Measure and verify performance meets target."
```

**Solution 2: Review and Optimize**
```
"Review this code for performance issues:

[paste code]

Identify:
- N+1 query problems
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) or worse)
- Missing indexes
- Unnecessary computations
- Memory leaks

Then optimize to meet <500ms target."
```

**Solution 3: Request Complexity Analysis**
```
"Implement [algorithm] with:

Time complexity: O(n log n) or better
Space complexity: O(n) or better

Include Big-O analysis in comments.
If can't meet complexity target, explain why."
```

**Prevention:**
- Always mention performance requirements
- Specify acceptable complexity
- Request performance analysis
- Profile before and after

---

### Insecure Code Generation

**Symptom:** AI generates code with security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, insecure authentication, etc.)

**Root causes:**
1. Security not mentioned
2. Convenience prioritized over security
3. Model trained on insecure examples

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Security Audit Prompt**
```
"Security audit this code:

[paste code]

Check for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Insecure authentication/authorization
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure cryptography
- Injection flaws
- Broken access control

For each vulnerability found:
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Exploitation scenario
- Fix with secure code example"
```

**Solution 2: Security Requirements Upfront**
```
"Implement user authentication with these security requirements:

Authentication:
- Passwords hashed with argon2 (not bcrypt or plain)
- Salt unique per user
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Secure random token generation
- HTTPS only (no HTTP)

Authorization:
- User can only access own resources
- Admin role checked server-side
- No client-side auth checks

Input validation:
- SQL parameterized queries (prevent injection)
- HTML sanitization (prevent XSS)
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

Follow OWASP Top 10 best practices."
```

**Solution 3: Use Security Checklist**
```
"After generating code, verify security:
- [ ] No SQL injection (parameterized queries)
- [ ] No XSS (input sanitization)
- [ ] No CSRF (tokens for POST/PUT/DELETE)
- [ ] Passwords hashed (argon2/bcrypt)
- [ ] JWT secure (secret in env, expiration set)
- [ ] Authorization checked server-side
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] HTTPS enforced

If any check fails, fix before responding."
```

**Prevention:**
- Security-first prompting
- Use security templates
- Regular security audits
- Follow [OWASP guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

## Workflow Bottlenecks

### Too Many Iterations

**Symptom:** Takes 5-10+ iterations to get working code.

**Root causes:**
1. Vague initial prompts
2. No examples provided
3. Missing context

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Study Prompt Foundations**
```
Take 30 minutes to read:
[Prompt Foundations Guide](../prompting/foundations.md)

Learn the 4-component framework:
1. Clarity: What you want (specific)
2. Context: What AI needs (files, patterns)
3. Constraints: Boundaries (limits, requirements)
4. Criteria: Success (how to verify)

Apply to next prompt.
```

**Solution 2: Use Templates**
```
Don't write prompts from scratch.
Use [Template Library](../prompting/template-library.md):

1. Find template matching your task
2. Fill in {{PLACEHOLDERS}}
3. Send to AI

First-try success rate: 70-90%
```

**Solution 3: Add Examples**
```
Every prompt should include:

Example 1: [Input] → [Expected output]
Example 2: [Input] → [Expected output]
Example 3: [Edge case] → [Expected handling]

Examples eliminate ambiguity.
```

**Prevention:**
- Always use detailed prompts
- Include examples
- Define success criteria
- Use templates

---

### Repeating Same Instructions

**Symptom:** You find yourself explaining the same conventions, patterns, or requirements in every prompt.

**Root causes:**
1. No persistent project configuration
2. Each session starts fresh

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Create .cursorrules**
```
Create `.cursorrules` in project root with all conventions:

# Project Conventions

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

## Code Style
[Your style guide]

## Patterns
[Your common patterns]

## Don't Repeat
- Always use argon2 for passwords (not bcrypt)
- Always use Prisma (not raw SQL)
- Always use functional components (not classes)
- [Other frequent instructions]
```

Now AI automatically knows these without you repeating.

**Solution 2: Create docs/conventions.md**
```
Create detailed conventions document:

docs/conventions/
├── code-style.md
├── api-design.md
├── database-patterns.md
├── testing-guidelines.md
└── security-requirements.md

Reference in prompts:
"Follow conventions in docs/conventions/api-design.md"
```

**Solution 3: Session Setup Prompt**
```
At start of each session:
"Project setup:
- Read .cursorrules
- Read docs/architecture/overview.md
- Follow patterns from src/api/users.ts

Confirm you understand the project structure."

Then proceed with specific task.
```

**Prevention:**
- Create .cursorrules early
- Document conventions
- Reference docs in prompts

---

### Difficulty Resuming Work

**Symptom:** When you come back to a project after days/weeks, it takes a long time to figure out where you left off.

**Root causes:**
1. No session documentation
2. No current-state tracking
3. Relying on memory

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Session Handoff Pattern**
```
At end of each work session:
"Create session handoff document at docs/context/session-[date].md:

## Completed Today
- [What was implemented]
- [What was fixed]
- [What was decided]

## Current State
- [Feature X]: 80% complete (need: task A, task B)
- [Feature Y]: Not started
- [Bug Z]: Fixed and tested

## Important Context
- [Architectural decisions made]
- [Technical challenges encountered]
- [Workarounds implemented]

## Next Session
1. [First task to tackle]
2. [Second task]
3. [Third task]

## Files Modified
- [List of files changed]"
```

**Solution 2: Current State Document**
```
Maintain docs/context/current-state.md:

Update after major changes:
"Update docs/context/current-state.md with:
- Recently completed features
- In-progress features
- Known issues
- Next priorities"
```

**Solution 3: Git Commit History**
```
Write detailed commit messages:
"feat(auth): implement JWT token refresh

- Added refresh token to user model
- Created /auth/refresh endpoint
- Tokens expire after 24h, refresh extends
- Tests added for token refresh flow

Related to feature spec: docs/plans/auth-feature.md
Next: Implement logout (invalidate tokens)"
```

**Prevention:**
- End-of-session handoffs
- Maintain current-state.md
- Detailed commit messages
- Use TodoWrite/Task Manager MCP

### High AI Costs

**Symptom:** Monthly AI bills are surprisingly high.

**Root causes:**
1. Inefficient prompting (repeating context)
2. Using expensive models for simple tasks
3. Not optimizing context

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Track Usage**
```
Monitor:
- Tokens per feature (prompt + response)
- Model used for each task
- Context size per session

Baseline: "Feature X took 50k tokens with Claude Sonnet = $1.50"
Target: "Feature X should take 10k tokens = $0.30"
```

**Solution 2: Use Right Model for Task**
```
Task complexity vs Model cost:

Simple (boilerplate, templates):
→ GLM (super cheap, 5h coding time limit)
→ Qwen Coder (cheap)
→ Gemini Flash (cheap)

Standard (most features):
→ Claude Sonnet (balanced)
→ GLM (great price/performance)

Complex (architecture, debugging):
→ Claude Sonnet (reliable)
→ Claude Opus (only when necessary)

Cost difference: 10-50× between models
```

**Solution 3: Optimize Prompts**
```
Apply token optimization:

Before (50k tokens):
"[Paste entire architecture doc]
[Paste 10 code files]
[Detailed explanation]
Now implement feature X"

After (5k tokens):
"Reference docs/architecture/overview.md (read earlier).
Implement feature X following pattern in src/api/users.ts.
Requirements: [concise list]"

90% token reduction!
```

**Prevention:**
- Use [Prompt Optimization](../prompting/advanced-techniques.md#prompt-optimization)
- Choose appropriate models
- Externalize context to .md files
- Use templates

---

## Tool-Specific Problems

### Claude Code: File Search Issues

**Symptom:** Claude Code CLI can't find files you know exist.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Use Glob tool (not bash find)
"Use Glob tool to find *.tsx files in src/components/"

# Be specific with patterns
"Find files matching src/api/**/*.ts"

# Check current directory
"What is the current working directory?
List files in this directory."
```

---

### Claude Code: Agent Issues

**Symptom:** Task/Explore agents fail or return poor results.

**Solutions:**

```
# Choose right agent
Explore agent: "Quick search for authentication files"
Plan agent: "Plan multi-step feature implementation"
General: "Complex research requiring multiple tools"

# Specify thoroughness
"Use Explore agent with 'very thorough' mode to find all test files"

# Break down task if too complex
Instead of: "Agent: research entire codebase"
Do: "Agent: find authentication-related files in src/"
Then: "Agent: analyze authentication flow in [found files]"
```

---

### Cursor: Composer Failures

**Symptom:** Cursor Composer times out or produces poor results.

**Solutions:**

```
# Reduce file count in composer
- Include max 5-10 files
- Use @codebase sparingly (very expensive)
- Be specific with @file references

# Clear context
Cmd+K → Clear context → Start fresh

# Use Chat instead for complex tasks
Composer: Quick edits, small changes
Chat: Research, planning, complex features
```

---

### Droid CLI: Plan Mode Problems

**Symptom:** Droid's plan mode gets stuck or generates poor plans.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Be more specific with planning request
droid plan "Implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens,
including user registration, login, token refresh endpoints"

# Break large plan into phases
droid plan "Phase 1: User registration and login"
# Complete Phase 1
droid plan "Phase 2: JWT refresh token mechanism"

# Review and edit plan before executing
# Plans are in .tasks/ directory
# Edit manually if needed
```

---

### MCP DevTools: Connection Issues

**Symptom:** DevTools MCP can't connect to browser.

**Solutions:**

```
1. Check Chrome/Edge is running
2. Check DevTools protocol enabled:
   Chrome: --remote-debugging-port=9222
3. Restart MCP server
4. Check MCP configuration in settings
5. Verify no firewall blocking localhost:9222
```

---

## Common Error Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Cannot read property 'X' of undefined"

**What it means:** Accessing property on null/undefined object.

**Common causes:**
- API returned null but not checked
- Array/object destructuring on undefined
- Async timing issue (accessing before loaded)

**AI prompting fix:**
```
"Fix null pointer error:
[paste error + code]

Add null checks:
- Check if object exists before accessing
- Use optional chaining (?.)
- Provide default values
- Handle loading/error states"
```

---

### Pattern 2: "Module not found"

**What it means:** Import can't find the file/package.

**Common causes:**
- Typo in import path
- File doesn't exist
- Package not installed
- Incorrect relative path

**AI prompting fix:**
```
"Fix module not found error:
Error: Cannot find module './components/UserCard'

Context:
- File structure: [describe]
- Trying to import from: [file]
- Target file location: [path]

Verify file exists and fix import path."
```

---

### Pattern 3: "Maximum call stack size exceeded"

**What it means:** Infinite recursion.

**Common causes:**
- Recursive function with no base case
- Circular dependency
- useEffect with missing dependency array

**AI prompting fix:**
```
"Fix infinite recursion:
[paste error + code]

Find and fix:
- Missing base case in recursion
- Circular dependencies
- useEffect causing infinite loop"
```

---

## Debugging Checklist

When stuck, go through this systematically:

### Basic Checks
- [ ] Read the error message completely
- [ ] Check the stack trace for file:line
- [ ] Look at the code at that line

## Summary

### Quick Decision Trees

**"My code doesn't work"**
1. Do I have the error message? → Use Debug Template
2. Is the prompt vague? → Use detailed template
3. Is context too full? → Externalize to .md
4. Am I using right model? → Check task complexity

**"It's taking too long"**
1. Too many iterations? → Improve prompts
2. Context management issues? → Use .md files
3. Wrong workflow? → Use multi-step approach
4. High costs? → Optimize tokens, use cheaper models

**"AI behaves weirdly"**
1. Forgets things? → Check context usage
2. Ignores constraints? → Emphasize constraints
