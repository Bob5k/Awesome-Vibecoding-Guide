# Phase 3: Testing & Debugging üß™

**Tools:** DevTools MCP + Your coding agent + Manual Testing

## Process

1) Automated Testing via MCP:
> ‚ÄúUse DevTools MCP to test the login page and find bugs.‚Äù

Agent:
- Opens the browser
- Navigates the app
- Collects console errors
- Analyzes network calls
- Identifies issues
- Proposes a fix

2) Manual Testing:
- Walk through the functionality yourself
- Document edge cases
- Check different browsers/devices

3) Debugging Deep Dive:

Golden rule: Debugging is effective only when you dig deep.

Don‚Äôt:
"Doesn‚Äôt work, fix it"
"Still doesn‚Äôt work, fix pls" (x100)

Do:
Analyze the bug (manually or via MCP)

Gather logs specific to the issue

Identify the exact root cause

Tell the AI what you found + ask for a fix

If the same bug repeats 2‚Äì3 times:
1. Stop‚Äîsomething is fundamentally wrong
2. Use MCP to gather precise logs
3. Analyze them before the next prompt
4. You may need to change approach, not just code
