# Phase 4: Code Review & Refactoring 🔍

## Process
1. First pass—Claude 3.5 / GPT‑4o review of the entire feature codebase
2. Identify issues
   - Performance problems
   - Security holes
   - Code duplication
   - Convention violations
3. Refactoring—GLM implements suggestions
4. Second review—ensure everything works

### Beware over‑optimization
- If a simple bug requires a complete refactor → something’s off
- Try other models (Gemini, a different Claude)—maybe there’s a simpler solution
- Don’t let AI over‑engineer simple problems
