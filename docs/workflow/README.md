# Workflow & Process ðŸ”„

Vibecoding across five phasesâ€”from initial ideation through deployment. The modern workflow starts with external AI chat conversations to refine your ideas, then uses specialized tools like OpenSpec for project kickoff.

## The Modern Vibecoding Flow

**Ideation** â†’ Use any AI chat to explore and validate ideas â†’ Get PRD/description
**Planning** â†’ Feed PRD into OpenSpec with infrastructure details â†’ Generate project structure
**Environment Setup** â†’ Configure your IDE, coding agents, and MCP servers
**Development** â†’ Implement features systematically with AI assistance
**Testing & Refinement** â†’ Debug, review, refactor, and deploy

## Phases
- [Phase 1: Planning (Preâ€‘Development)](./phase-1-planning.md) - External chat ideation, PRD creation, OpenSpec project kickoff
- [Phase 2: Development](./phase-2-development.md) - Environment setup and feature implementation
- [Phase 3: Testing & Debugging](./phase-3-testing-debugging.md) - Automated and manual testing
- [Phase 4: Code Review & Refactoring](./phase-4-code-review-refactoring.md) - Code quality improvements
- [Phase 5: Deployment](./phase-5-deployment.md) - CI/CD and production deployment
