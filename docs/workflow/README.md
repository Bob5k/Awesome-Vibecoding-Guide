# Workflow & Process 🔄

Vibecoding across five phases—from initial ideation through deployment. The modern workflow starts with external AI chat conversations to refine your ideas, then uses specialized tools like OpenSpec for project kickoff.

## The Modern Vibecoding Flow

**Ideation** → Use any AI chat to explore and validate ideas → Get PRD/description
**Planning** → Feed PRD into OpenSpec with infrastructure details → Generate project structure
**Environment Setup** → Configure your IDE, coding agents, and MCP servers
**Development** → Implement features systematically with AI assistance
**Testing & Refinement** → Debug, review, refactor, and deploy

## Phases
- [Phase 1: Planning (Pre‑Development)](./phase-1-planning.md) - External chat ideation, PRD creation, OpenSpec project kickoff
- [Phase 2: Development](./phase-2-development.md) - Environment setup and feature implementation
- [Phase 3: Testing, Debugging & Code Review](./phase-3-testing-debugging.md) - Automated testing, debugging, and code quality improvements
- [Phase 4: Deployment](./phase-4-deployment.md) - CI/CD and production deployment
