# Introduction âœ¨

Vibecoding is an approach to software creation where you collaborate with AI as a coding partner. This guide is based on real commercial experienceâ€”projects delivered for clients using heavily AIâ€‘[...]

## Business model and tech stack ðŸ’¼ðŸ§°

- I run a simple, repeatable business model: find potential customers via social media or direct recommendations and deliver fast, polished sites.
- Target clients: small local businesses (electricians, plumbers, hairdressers, etc.) â€” many of them either have a clunky WordPress site or no site at all.
- My proposition: offer lightweight, modern static sites as a better alternative to most smallâ€‘business WordPress installs â€” simpler, faster, cheaper to host and maintain.
- Core stack I use:
  - Astro â€” super easy to hit excellent Core Web Vitals scores and ship minimal clientâ€‘side JS.
  - Tailwind â€” my goâ€‘to styling framework: fast to author, consistent, and highly productive.
  - Cloudflare Pages â€” insanely fast, free (for static sites), and perfect for hosting Astro output.
- Why this stack works for small businesses:
  - Static Astro sites minimize complexity and hosting cost while maximizing performance.
  - Tailwind keeps design iteration quick and maintainable.
  - Cloudflare Pages gives nearâ€‘instant global delivery for static content.
- Maintenance & updates:
  - Static sites do require codeâ€‘level updates, but most small clients rarely need frequent changes.
  - Simple edits (phone number, prices, a new photo) are quick â€” often ~10 minutes â€” and can be automated or done via a local/remote AI agent.
- SEO & success metrics:
  - Focus on performance (aim for 85+ on Performance and 100 on other PageSpeed metrics), good UX, structured data, and proper meta tags â€” not just keyword stuffing.
  - A wellâ€‘built, highâ€‘performing site usually converts and brings referrals â€” one happy client tends to lead to more.
- The pitch in one line: fast, modern, lowâ€‘maintenance sites that actually perform â€” a better fit for most small businesses than a heavyweight WordPress setup.
- Also **have in mind** that you could potentially sell such sites for less than usual WP site - as with vibecoding - development is seamless and with proper stack - which I'm talking in this repo about - it's like chatting with your project usually (and it's not expensive, so it pays for a year of your stack after your first, demo gig for $200)
