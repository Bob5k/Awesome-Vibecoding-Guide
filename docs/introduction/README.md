# Introduction ✨

Vibecoding is an approach to software creation where you collaborate with AI as a coding partner. This guide is based on real commercial experience—projects delivered for clients using heavily AI‑assisted workflows.

## Core Philosophy 🎯

Before diving into specific tools and techniques, it's important to understand my approach to tool selection and workflow design. My philosophy focuses on finding the right balance between cost, reliability, integration, and performance.

The key takeaway: Often, the combination of multiple specialized, cost-effective tools outperforms a single expensive "all-in-one" solution.

## Who am I?

- Head of Department with over 10 years in software development
- 6 years as Head of Department, involved in software development (process and engineering)
- Freelancer vibecoder—building software for local businesses
- AI experience since the early GPT beta
- Delivering commercial projects for companies with €100M–€1B annual revenue (mainly e‑commerce)

## What will you learn?

- How to save ~70% on AI tool costs without sacrificing quality
- How to manage context effectively in long‑term projects
- How to avoid pitfalls and the most common vibecoding mistakes
- How to build a reliable tool stack tailored to your needs
- How to deliver commercial projects powered entirely by AI

But the most important thing here (potentially):
- How to build a successful, freelance brand and pivot into making money out of vibecoding

## Business model and tech stack 💼🧰

- I run a simple, repeatable business model: find potential customers via social media or direct recommendations and deliver fast, polished sites.
- Target clients: small local businesses (electricians, plumbers, hairdressers, etc.) — many of them either have a clunky WordPress site or no site at all.
- My proposition: offer lightweight, modern static sites as a better alternative to most small‑business WordPress installs — simpler, faster, cheaper to host and maintain.
- Core stack I use:
  - Astro — super easy to hit excellent Core Web Vitals scores and ship minimal client‑side JS.
  - Tailwind — my go‑to styling framework: fast to author, consistent, and highly productive.
  - Cloudflare Pages — insanely fast, free (for static sites), and perfect for hosting Astro output.
- Why this stack works for small businesses:
  - Static Astro sites minimize complexity and hosting cost while maximizing performance.
  - Tailwind keeps design iteration quick and maintainable.
  - Cloudflare Pages gives near‑instant global delivery for static content.
- Maintenance & updates:
  - Static sites do require code‑level updates, but most small clients rarely need frequent changes.
  - Simple edits (phone number, prices, a new photo) are quick — often ~10 minutes — and can be automated or done via a local/remote AI agent.
- SEO & success metrics:
  - Focus on performance (aim for 85+ on Performance and 100 on other PageSpeed metrics), good UX, structured data, and proper meta tags — not just keyword stuffing.
  - A well‑built, high‑performing site usually converts and brings referrals — one happy client tends to lead to more.
- The pitch in one line: fast, modern, low‑maintenance sites that actually perform — a better fit for most small businesses than a heavyweight WordPress setup.
- Also **have in mind** that you could potentially sell such sites for less than usual WP site - as with vibecoding - development is seamless and with proper stack - which I'm talking in this repo about - it's like chatting with your project usually (and it's not expensive, so it pays for a year of your stack after your first, demo gig for $200)
